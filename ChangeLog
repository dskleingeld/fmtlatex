	* fmtlatex: The argument slurper broke if the argument ended
	several lines after it began.  Fixed this by adding a checker to
	see if there are any closing braces/brackets still on the line and
	bailing out if not.

	Due to the way it works (always on the previous line), the line
	before `\documentclass` got put after `\begin{document}` if the
	preamble was being skipped.  So when we meet `\documentclass` then
	we flush the output to prevent this.

	* fmtlatex: Added a caveat to breaking at start of maths:
	shouldn't break if this is at the start of a line.

	* fmtlatex: Improved detection of preamble so that it detects the
	start of the preamble as well as the end (via 'documentclass').
	Added a switch to force processing of preamble.
	Comments on their own line are never indented, and whitespace
	between the start of a line and a % is ignored.
